# Spoteam (Class IAB330 at QUT)
Spoteam is an app that helps you finding your colleagues inside their workplace using NFC technologies. 

This project was developed in Xamarin using MvvM as its software design pattern.

Note: This project was made in 1-week for the final project for a unit at Queensland University of Technology. Feel free to use it as a reference, but its codebase is very messy and unorganised due to its short deadline.
